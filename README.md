# SkillCraftTechnology
Iâ€™ve successfully completed my Summer Internship at SkillCraft Technology under the Web Development track. I built projects like a landing page, calculator, tic-tac-toe, quiz, and to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience and boosting my skills.
